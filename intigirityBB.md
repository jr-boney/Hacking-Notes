I understand you're a **beginner bug bounty hunter** with a background in full-stack development, and you're excited to dive into bug bounty hunting. I'll guide you step-by-step on how to approach the domains and environments you've provided for your first bug bounty hunt. We'll go through this in a structured way, breaking it down into stages.

Since you're using **Kali Linux**, you'll have access to a lot of the essential tools. Let’s walk through the steps.

### 1. **Initial Reconnaissance and Information Gathering**

Before starting with **active scanning** or **exploiting vulnerabilities**, we need to gather as much information as possible about the domains and the systems involved. The more you know about the target, the better you’ll be at finding weaknesses.

#### Tools to Use:
- **nmap**: For scanning open ports and identifying services.
- **sublist3r**: For subdomain enumeration.
- **whatweb**: To identify technologies used.
- **dirb/dirbuster**: For directory and file brute-forcing.

#### Steps:
1. **Start with Subdomain Enumeration**:
   Since you’ve got wildcards (`*.pdq.com`, `*.simplemdm.com`, `*.smartdeploy.com`), it’s important to find out the subdomains of these domains. This is critical because many bug bounty programs don’t explicitly state all subdomains, and discovering more subdomains can lead to potential vulnerabilities.

   Use tools like `Sublist3r` or `Amass` to discover subdomains.
   ```bash
   sublist3r -d pdq.com -o pdq_subdomains.txt
   sublist3r -d simplemdm.com -o simplemdm_subdomains.txt
   sublist3r -d smartdeploy.com -o smartdeploy_subdomains.txt
   ```

2. **Gather Information about the URLs (Specific in-scope URLs)**:
   From the scope, the test environments you should focus on are:
   - `https://a.simplemdm.com/`
   - `https://auth2.pdq.tools/`
   - `https://library-staging.pdq.tools/`
   - `https://houston-staging.pdq.tools/`
   - `https://portal-staging.pdq.tools/`

   Make sure to check these URLs for any potential subdomains or directories. Use **WhatWeb** or **Wappalyzer** to gather details about the technologies and frameworks used on these sites:
   ```bash
   whatweb https://a.simplemdm.com/
   whatweb https://auth2.pdq.tools/
   ```

3. **Look for Any Public Information**:
   Sometimes a lot of useful information is available through Google Dorking, forum posts, or even outdated documents. Look for anything in public repositories (e.g., GitHub, forums, etc.) related to `pdq.com`, `simplemdm.com`, or `smartdeploy.com`.

   **Example Google Dorking**: 
   - `"site:pdq.com" filetype:pdf`
   - `"site:pdq.com" "confidential"`

### 2. **Recon on Specific Test Environments**

#### Tools:
- **Burp Suite**: For intercepting and analyzing HTTP/S traffic (proxying).
- **Dirbuster** or **Gobuster**: For brute-forcing directories and files.

#### Steps:
1. **Exploring Test Environments**:
   Focus on these test URLs, as they're the areas where you’re encouraged to test. Since they are labeled as **test environments**, they are meant to be more forgiving for testing.

   a) Open each URL and interact with them manually in a browser to get an understanding of their functionality.
   
   b) Use **Burp Suite** to proxy and inspect the requests you make. Look for:
   - Parameters in the URL (e.g., `?id=123`)
   - Form fields (e.g., login forms, search boxes)
   - Cookies and session tokens
   
   **Example with Burp Suite**:
   1. Start Burp Suite.
   2. Configure your browser to use **Burp as a proxy**.
   3. Browse the in-scope URLs and analyze HTTP requests and responses.

2. **Directory and File Brute-Forcing**:
   Sometimes hidden files or directories could be exposed on the server that aren’t publicly accessible through the main interface. Use **Gobuster** or **Dirbuster** to brute-force directories and files.
   
   Example with Gobuster:
   ```bash
   gobuster dir -u https://a.simplemdm.com/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
   gobuster dir -u https://auth2.pdq.tools/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
   ```

   This will attempt to find hidden directories or files by comparing URL patterns with known wordlist patterns.

### 3. **Fuzzing Inputs and Identifying Vulnerabilities**

Once you have a basic understanding of the application, it’s time to start identifying potential vulnerabilities. The most common vulnerabilities are:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Command Injection**
- **Broken Authentication**

#### Tools:
- **Burp Suite (Intruder, Repeater)**: For fuzzing and replaying requests.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Another tool similar to Burp Suite for security testing.
- **sqlmap**: For automating SQL injection testing.
- **XSSer**: For detecting and exploiting XSS vulnerabilities.

#### Steps:
1. **Start with Basic Fuzzing**:
   - **Fuzz for XSS**: Look for input fields (login forms, search bars, etc.) that accept user input.
     - Use **Burp Suite’s Intruder** to send common XSS payloads to input fields (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
     - Look for any reflections of the payload back in the HTML response.
   
   **Example XSS Payload**:
   ```html
   <script>alert('XSS')</script>
   ```
   
   - **Fuzz for SQL Injection**: Check for parameters in the URL or forms that might be vulnerable to SQL injection. You can automate this using **sqlmap**.

   ```bash
   sqlmap -u "https://a.simplemdm.com/?id=1" --batch --dbs
   ```

   **sqlmap** will attempt to detect and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.

2. **Check for CSRF**:
   Test if forms on the in-scope URLs are vulnerable to **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**. CSRF usually occurs when a form can be submitted without proper token validation (or if the token is predictable).

   **Example test**: Try to submit a form from a different site to see if you can change settings or perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user.

3. **Test for Authentication Issues**:
   - Check if you can **bypass login pages** or **account lockouts**. You can use tools like **Hydra** for brute-force attacks or test weak login mechanisms manually.
   - Look for **weak password policies**, such as easily guessable credentials or lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA).

4. **Check for Security Misconfigurations**:
   - Inspect HTTP headers for security headers like `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `Content-Security-Policy`.
   - Use Burp Suite to check if sensitive information like API keys, session cookies, or database dumps is being exposed.

### 4. **Report Findings and Submit a Valid Report**

Once you find a vulnerability, make sure your findings are well-documented. Follow the **Intigriti reporting guidelines** to submit a clear and concise report.

- **Document the vulnerability**: Include the affected URL, vulnerability type (XSS, SQLi, etc.), and steps to reproduce.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Provide a working PoC that demonstrates the exploit.
- **Impact**: Explain why this vulnerability is dangerous and how it can be exploited.
- **Remediation**: Suggest how the issue can be fixed (e.g., input sanitization for XSS, parameterized queries for SQLi).
